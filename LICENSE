Log snippet:
Feb 11 15:59:02 <Snipa>	Hallo!  Wanted to reach out as we finally released the pool software w/ the FFS funded at this point.  https://github.com/Snipa22/nodejs-pool  <redacted>.  The following code: https://pb.junaos.xyz/view/cd3d7e27 is what was snagged, and mostly rebuilt along the way for good measure.
Feb 11 15:59:02 <Snipa>	 I'm not sure how deeply the GPL requires me to go to claim it as "new code" given that the logic behind it all is about the same.
<redacted>
Feb 11 16:09:39 <Snipa>	.fr is now 1/5th of the overall mining power, DP is another 1/5th.
Feb 11 16:09:48 <Snipa>	We're getting scary-close to the 50% attacks.
Feb 11 16:10:08 <zone117x>	You have my permission to MIT
Feb 11 16:10:31 <Snipa>	Thank you.  I'll get our licenses updated and such today.
